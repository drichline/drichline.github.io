# About the website

I started this website as a hobby project in 2018, then continued updating it as a hobby and platform to post various things I've written. Freshman year of college (2020) was when I really did any technical writing for the first time, and thus had actual content to put on the site. One thing I really enjoy about running a personal website is that I donâ€™t really have to worry about things like broken links and downtime; it mostly exists for my sake. 

It's running Hugo with a scratch-written custom theme, which initially started as a clone of [Hugo-Octopress](https://github.com/parsiya/Hugo-Octopress). Over time, it was continually updated to reflect my personal style. I was initially drawn to Octopress because it strongly resembled Apple's old skeuomorphic design, but my preferred style ended up evolving into a simpler, modern dark theme.
