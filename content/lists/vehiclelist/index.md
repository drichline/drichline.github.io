In roughly chronological order (oldest to most recent), these are the vehicles I've owned and some facts about them

1. 2005 Nissan Sentra
    * Base model "bar of soap with wheels"
    * Inherited from a family member
    * Crashed into 3 times before I got it!
2. [1991 Honda Nighthawk 250](/pages/nighthawkessay)
    * My first motorcycle
    * Woefully underpowered: 13 kW (17 hp) at the engine!

3. 2005 Harley-Davidson Sportster 883
    * Upgrade from the Honda that's more highway-capable
    * Suprisingly uncomfortable in its stock configuration (Harley's "aesthetic" air cleaner gave me bruises ðŸ¤”)
    * [Absurdly loud with straight pipes](/pages/harleyengine/)

4. 2001 Mercedes CLK 320 Convertible
    * Purchased to replace the Harley when I quit riding
    * Very easy, but expensive, to work on
    * Was stolen in Florida in 2003, then recovered and sold as a wedding gift in Pennsylvania, then sat in a garage its whole life before being bought and moved back to Florida

5. 2019 Mitsubishi Mirage G4
    * Replaced the CLK due to expensive suspension issues (needed several struts and control arms)
    * Has a bumper-to-bumper warranty until 2029!
    * Despite only having 58 kW (78 hp), it's not bad to drive due to its [amazing transmission](https://web.archive.org/web/20180621102802/http://mirageforum.com/forum/showthread.php/656-Information-about-the-Mirage-CVT-(Jatco-CVT7-JF015E)-operation-video-diagrams), light weight, and electric steering
