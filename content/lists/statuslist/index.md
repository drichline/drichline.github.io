Below are some Discord statuses I've used and enjoyed, which tend to be references to my favorite media:

* 🪦 Be Just and Fear Not

* 🏳️‍🌈 Don't dream it, be it...

* 🌎 Crawling on the planet's face, some insects called the human race

* 🌌 Hazy Cosmic Jive

* ✏️ You're as sensual as a pencil

* 🗽 See the mice in their million hordes
