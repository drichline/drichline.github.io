I designed this apron in 2019 for an industrial sewing class at the [NCC Fab Lab](/pages/fablab). Unfortunately, it was the last project I ever worked on in the Lab. 

Deluth makes the best apron I've ever worn, so I decided to copy my favorite features and sew one with denim and nylon straps. No pictures because I don't have either of the aprons anymore

The dashed line is for trim around the edges. If you sew one of these aprons, make sure to cut the bottom pocket extra-long so it flops open and you can stick tools in it!
