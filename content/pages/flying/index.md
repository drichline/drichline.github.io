It's a strange origin story, but a combination of meeting a pilot and playing too much GTA got me interested in aviation. I took my first discovery flight at KXLL in 2017, and another in 2018 in a '68 Navajo. I was working on a sport license with AB Flight/Gateway Aviation at KXLL and reached the solo sign-off, but never soloed or progressed further for personal reasons. 

The Evektor Harmony I flew is an incredibly sweet-flying aircraft. It has a great interior with full glass and a bubble canopy, and it's responsive to fingertip pressure. I initially learned to land without flaps, and still never bounced a landing thanks to the Harmony's excellent handling in ground effect. My only complaints were are difficult to adjust rudder pedals and an annoying screw throttle.
