In learning the definition of a candela (watts per steradian of visible light), I realized that lumens are simpler and easier to understand despite being a derived unit. They're also widely used in the real world, unlike candela.

The original definition of a candela is the luminous intensity of a whale fat candle. If the entire point of a candle is to radiate in every direction, shouldn't the base unit measure the total flux (light) the candle produces? Using lumen as a base unit is also simpler because its definition would equal the power of a light source weighted for human vision, and there's no need to understand solid angle unless you need to use the (very niche) candela.
