### Note: this article was revised in [Revisiting the "Pi Business Card"](/pages/juliapi)

*Warning: my calculus and programming skills are pretty amateurish. Experts, try not to cringe*

I saw a reddit comment claiming you can calculate Ï€ using a circle, and immediately had three thoughts: 

1. That's freaking awesome
2. It's probably a bad thing that I don't know how to do that
3. That would be awesome on the back of a business card

So, I started banging rocks together with a calculator until I figured out the equations. 

## Where *does* Ï€ come from?

For the uninitiated, Ï€ is just the ratio between a circle's diameter and circumference. If you laid a 1 foot wide circle of string on the floor, that piece of string would be 3.14 feet long. In other words, its circumference is equal to Ï€ times the diameter: \\\(c=2\pi r\\\). There are plenty of efficient formulas to calculate the value of Ï€, but it's difficult to understand *why* they converge to Ï€ as a naÃ¯ve student. 

## Area of a circle and Ï€

The area of a circle is Ï€ times the radius squared: \\\(A=\pi r^2\\\). If the radius of the circle is \\\(r=1\\\), its area is Ï€. If I want to solve for the value of Ï€, all I need to do is find the area of the \\\(r=1\\\) circle using another method, and the answer is Ï€! (\\\(A=\pi\\\)) 

A circle is defined by the equation \\\(x^2+y^2=r^2\\\), and half the circle is \\\(y=\sqrt{r^2-x^2}\\\).

{{< figure alt="Graph of half a circle" src="halfcircle.png" caption="Graph of \\\(y=\sqrt{r^2-x^2},r=1\\\)" >}}

Now that half of the circle is represented as a function of x, it's possible to find the area *underneath* that curve by taking the definite integral of the function. The integral of the function between 0 and 1 is really the area of 1/4 the circle (represented by the purple shaded region in the graph below). 

{{< figure alt="Graph of a full circle" src="fullcircle.png" caption="The circle is \\\(x^2+y^2=r^2,r=1\\\). The shaded region represents \\\(\int^1_0{\sqrt{1-x^2}dx}\\\), which is \\\(\frac{\pi}{4}\\\)" >}}

Therefore, taking the integral of 1/4 the circle, then multiplying by 4 is the area of the circle, which is equal to Ï€!

$$4\int^1_0{\sqrt{1-x^2}dx}=\pi$$

## Circumference of the Universe

The circumference of the Observable Universe is a great novelty problem to demonstrate the precision of Ï€. According to [NASA at JPL](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/edu/news/2016/3/16/how-many-decimals-of-pi-do-we-really-need/), 40 digits of Ï€ is precise enough to calculate it within the radius of a single hydrogen atom. JPL themselves only use 15 digits. 

## Putting it on a business card

As of writing this page, my very limited programming experience is in C++. Python looks like an awesome language, and its beautiful syntax is much more conducive to printing on a business card. ðŸ™‚ Using one of Python's many libraries to take the integral would be infinitely easier and more efficient, but using the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus (a Riemann sum) to approximate Ï€ is way cooler. To be clear, this is an extremely inefficient (but badass) way to calculate pi; I ran it for 10 billion iterations and couldn't even get close to 15 digits. 

{{< figure alt="Animated Riemann sum graph" src="Riemann_sum_(leftbox).gif" caption="A Riemann sum looks like this, with the rectangles becoming infinitely narrow. An integral is just the area of all the rectangles added together [1]" >}}


In my case, the integral can be represented as this Riemann sum: 

$$\pi=4\int^1_0{\sqrt{1-x^2}dx}=4\lim\limits_{n\to \infty}\sum_{i=1}^n\sqrt{1-(\frac{i}{n})^2}\cdot\frac{1}{n}$$

To approximate Ï€ in a computer program, the limit can be dropped and n replaced with a reasonably large number. This is how I translated it into python: 

{{< highlight python >}}
import math
n = 1000000
dx = (1/n)
s = 0
for i in range(1, n):
    x_i = (math.sqrt(1-math.pow((i/n),2))*dx)
    s += x_i
print("Approximate pi:", '{:0.6}'.format(4*s))
d = 8.8E26 # Observable universe, meters
print("Circumference of the Universe:", '{:0.1e}'.format(d*4*s,1), "m")
## Accurate to (8.4E-5)%, or 840 parts per billion!

Output:

Approximate pi: 3.14159
Circumference of the Universe: 2.8e+27 m
