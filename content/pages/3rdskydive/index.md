This is my most recent tandem jump at Skydive Sebastian. Before this jump, I did 5 minutes of tunnel at iFly Orlando. It was a lot of fun, but I had a lot of trouble keeping my legs straight and staying stable. Everyone at the dropzone wants me to start working on a license, but I'm not comfortable starting AFF until I get really good at tunnel; my big fear is getting into a spin or stuck on my back.
