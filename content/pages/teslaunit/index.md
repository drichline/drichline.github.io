Engineering Explained on YouTube enlightened me as to why fuel consumption is a better metric than fuel efficiency, especially for gas-powered cars. TL;DW: fuel consumption is usually more relevant, and it scales nonlinearly with fuel efficiency.

As shown by this graph of fuel efficiency (black) and fuel consumption (green), doubling the efficiency of a car DOES NOT halve the amount of gas it burns! For an electric car that's constrained by the amount of energy it can carry, I believe that energy consumption is more important to know than efficiency. Tesla is clearly on my side; they use W·h/km while some car companies display km/kW·h, or, even worse, MPGe (miles per gallon equivalent).

Europe's L/(100 km) is great and all, but it tickles me how elegant W·h/km is for electric cars. It directly translates the amount of consumed energy to real, skeumorphic units like watt-hours and kilometers in an easy-to-understand magnitude. Some people argue that derived units should be avoided, but I disagree. Imagine measuring your fuel/energy usage in base units that are impossible to visualize in the real world: m³/m for gas, or V·C/m for electric 😬
